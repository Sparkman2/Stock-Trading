# Stock-Trading-Simulation

This program simulates stock trading in a virtual enviornment. Using the AAPL.csv and MSFT.csv, the program uses historical market data to simulate two different stock trading algorithms: Moving Average and Relative Strength Index. The program buys and sells stock based on the algorithm.

# Running the code

Either clone or download the zip file and make sure that the AAPL.csv and MSFT.csv are in the same location as the stock_simulation.py. 

To run the program, either go on an IDE and run main.py or use the commande "python main.py"
