# Stock-Trading
Using Apple and Microsoft stock data csv, I created a stock trading algorithim that can run through the data. Additionally, it creates a  simulation of the stock trade by means of 2 different stock algorithims, Moving Average and Relative Strength Index. By using these 2 algorithims, the program lets me know when to buy or sell stock and prints out how much money I could make.
